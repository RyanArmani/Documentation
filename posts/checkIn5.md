## Check in 5

### Our Progress
This week has been extreamly efficient for us and we managed to get alot working. We were able to successfully connect our planet scale data base for the Add and view all button. We are still currently in the process of working out our delete Button in our view list as well as our search term logic. Here are some pictures to show our progress.

The site works so far except for two Buttons, The Delete Button and the Word Finder Button.

## Questions
1) We are having an Issue getting the Delete Button to work, When we add the `@click="${this.deleteTerm(this.item)}" ` into our render functon within our view-list.js it breaks the View all Button from working. Do you know why this could be?
