in the console.

Here is the results for when we click on the view all button. The only issue that we dont quiet understand with this is that when we click on the view all button it will only show blank spaces unless we have inputs in the Text fields.

## Backend


## What we need to work on this week
1. Make sure that our data that we are adding into the database from the Site is showing up correctly within the Planetscale CLI.
2. Setting up and figuring out how we are going to use the term-finder.js code that is liked with planetscale
3. We need to setup an accent card or something where we will display all defintions with their attributes in the fields
4. Work on the remove button once we have our data viewed on the page for everyone to see.
5. Work on adding the edit button to the view all list.
