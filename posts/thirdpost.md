## Frontend
This week we didnt really add much to the gui of the frontend. We were focusing more how to get the basics working before we start to get more creative with how it looks.

#### Getting the Endpoints to run without errors
![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0dfwkfs29664l8m3knnn.png)

So far We have setup the add button as well as the view all button but are running into the error shown above when trying to add data to the data base. 

Just for context, If you ar looking at our Vercel site, We are going to remove the edit line that is there and want to implement it into the view all portion once we get it running. Our idea is to have an edit button or icon next to each definition so they you can search through the list and find what you want to edit.

#Questions:

1. How are we connecting the .env file to the frontend. More so how is the ".env" file implemeted into the front end so our site is able to connect with the data base.
2. would the edit.js be similar to remove word.js file except the sql is just different?
